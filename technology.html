        <h3>Introduction to object oriented programming (OOP)</h3>
        <p class="date">01/03/2008</p>
        <p class="author">Gabriela C. Perez</p>
        <p>The transition from a procedural programming (non-OOP) language to an object-oriented programming language is a large step for many programmers. It is true that both methods of programming can ultimately achieve the same goals, but you will find OOP is a neater and faster way to program, it is more suitable for teamwork, and programs are usually easier to design using the object-oriented approach. With OOP in Java, you will find that programming is challenging to begin with, yet very easy and very rewarding once you master it.</p>

        <h3>Regular expressions in java</h3>
        <p class="date">01/02/2008</p>
        <p class="author">Gabriela C. Perez</p>
        <p>A regular expression is a code that is used to match a pattern in a given string and is new to Java 1.4. Regular expressions are made up of normal characters and metacharacters. Normal characters are like letters, numbers, underscores, etc., whereas metacharacters are characters that have a special function and are used in conjunction with normal characters in order to define a type of pattern to match to string data. In the String class, you can use the method matches to match a regular expression passed as a parameter of type String to the characters in a String object, returning true if the match was found and false if it was not.</p>
